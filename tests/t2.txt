Generate text on the basis of the provided sentences. Use my sentences if possible.
Follow these basic rules basic:
1. Each sentence 25 words.
2. Use we as subj pronoun
3. I will use a similar yaml and markdown syntax to write answers. Parse it and convert in latex syntax e.g., # Introduction should be converted to \begin{section} introduction
4. Use present simple
Also follows Latex rules:
- Use longtable with M{0.x\linewidth} as cell type. Use vertical lines, and \\ \hline for each row
- Do not write\begin{document}, just give me latex text
- Always put labels and captions in images, sections, and tables
[Table] write a table: [caption] is the caption, [head] the comma separated values
